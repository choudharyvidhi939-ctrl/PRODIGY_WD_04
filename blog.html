        <h2>Welcome to My Blog </h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="50">
        Hi, I’m <b>Vidhi Choudhary</b>! This blog is a little corner where I share 
        my journey of learning, experimenting, and growing as a developer. 
        My path into the world of coding has been full of curiosity, challenges, 
        and exciting discoveries.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
        I first started learning the basics of computers and programming during 
        my college years. Classes introduced me to <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>, 
        and I still remember the excitement of seeing my first “Hello World” 
        website come alive in a browser. Those small wins motivated me to dive 
        deeper into the field of web development.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="150">
        Outside of college, I enrolled in <b>computer classes</b> where I learned 
        about <b>PHP, databases, and more structured programming concepts</b>. 
        These classes gave me confidence and helped me understand how different 
        technologies come together to create functional applications.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
        Alongside my formal learning, I also started exploring online resources. 
        <b>YouTube tutorials</b> became my late-night teachers — guiding me through 
        concepts like <b>React, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Python scripting</b>. 
        I also practiced small projects at home, like creating simple apps and 
        experimenting with new designs, which really strengthened my confidence.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="250">
        One of the most exciting projects I worked on was a <b>Movie Playlist Manager 
        in Python</b>. It was challenging at first, but it helped me connect theory 
        with practical problem-solving. I also created mini React apps to practice 
        component-based development and improve my design sense.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
        Looking back, I feel proud of how far I’ve come. From learning basics in 
        college, sharpening skills in computer classes, and pushing myself with 
        self-learning on YouTube — each step has shaped me into who I am today. 
        And this is just the beginning! I look forward to building bigger projects, 
        writing tutorials, and sharing more of my experiences here in this blog.
